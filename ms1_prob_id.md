# Milestone 1 Problem Identification

What is it that is unknown or erroneous?
Others in athlete bio that we are used to finding are duplicate individuals due to spelling, accents, or name ordering; missing or formatting errors in date of birth; inconsistent sex markers (M, F, Male, female); implausible height or weight figures and some unit confusion; NOC codes that are not matched to the list of countries. Mixed performance formats are found in event results of sports (times, distances, textual tokens such as DNF/DNS/DSQ), nonstandard medal tokens, nonuniform event and edition names and rows that refer to athleteid or editionid that are not present. In the country data, there may be duplicate or historic NOCs (EUN, ROC, IOA, AIN), trailing spaces and alternative spellings. Games data can vary in the edition text and editionid format and start/end dates can be non-ISO or missing. Paris 2024 data is generally defined by alternate column names and IDs, by day first dates or decimal commas, and has additional fields not found in the legacy set.

What will be done with wrong or unknown data?
For MS1 we do not drop records. We eliminate whitespace, replace frequent instances of common null tokens (NA, N/A, null, “–”, “—”, “?”) Dates are converted to ISO; when it fails to do it, we leave it blank. Values of heights and weights that are not within reasonable ranges are stored but marked to be reviewed later. Our performance text is given verbatim, and medal tokens are only normalized to Gold, Silver, Bronze, or empty. In the non-resolving foreign keys (athleteid, editionid, NOC), we retain the row and record the problem. The prototype requirement is met by generating all the five outputs, namely, copy bios, countries, and games; results, append a new age column at the extreme right with blank values; create newmedaltally.csv with no header.

How will Paris data be structured, how does this correspond to the original files and how are duplicate athletes to be identified?
We project Paris fields into a canonical schema which reflects the legacy files: decompose or normalize names to given and family name, convert Gender/Sex to M/F, normalize BirthDate to ISO, match NOC or Nation to the country list, map the Paris edition to our editionid on the games file, and project the Paris edition to our versionid on the version field. The absence of a compatible athleteid in Paris would cause us to construct a deterministic such due to the normalized name, DOB, sex and NOC so that it is a constant among runs. Two-stage duplicate detection between Paris and legacy. First, an exact match on normalized names, as well as exactly the same DOB and sex (and NOC if the same). Second, similarity check of name using fuzzy name similarity check with tie-breakers such as NOC and, where possible, height/weight or place of origin. Potential duplicates are only logged in MS1, a later step merges the actual records to a single canonical athleteid.

What will we do to know when the application is operational?
Each run should leave the five necessary files with the precise headers and the event results file should be the last one with the column of ages at the very end with additional blank field in every row. There should be no duplicates of countries by NOC, games by edition_id and run should be completed without errors. On the diagnostics log should be a short list of any parsing, plausibility or foreign-key errors so we can observe what to do with MS2. When the same inputs are re-run, they are expected to produce the same outputs.

Specific records to check
The use of accented names or hyphens to ensure that the names have been normalized is acceptable. Extremely frequent names to search duplicate detection. Rows with DNF/DNS/DSQ to make sure we do not misinterpret the performance values. NOC neutral or historic verifies country mapping IOA, AIN, ROC. Oldest and newest versions to edge cases of date format. In case you wish me to make this adjust to your real files, send the headers or a few sample rows.
