## Overview ##
Defines a comprehensive event name mapping dictionary (EVENT_MAP) that translates Paris 2024 event naming format to historical Olympic event naming format.

## Purpose
Paris 2024 uses different event naming conventions than historical Olympics. This map ensures event names are standardized across datasets for proper matching and result aggregation. 


## Structure
pythonEVENT_MAP = {
    "Men's 100m Athletics": "100 metres, Men",
    "Women's Individual Archery": "Individual, Women",
    # ... 330+ mappings
}


### Coverage
- **330+ event mappings** covering all Paris 2024 Olympic sports
- Sports included:
  - Athletics (track & field, race walk, marathon)
  - Aquatics (swimming, diving, artistic swimming, water polo)
  - Gymnastics (artistic, rhythmic, trampoline)
  - Combat sports (boxing, judo, wrestling, taekwondo, fencing)
  - Team sports (basketball, volleyball, handball, hockey, football, rugby)
  - Racquet sports (tennis, badminton, table tennis)
  - Cycling (road, track, mountain bike, BMX)
  - Water sports (rowing, canoe/kayak, sailing, surfing)
  - New sports (breaking, skateboarding, sport climbing)
  - Others (archery, equestrian, shooting, weightlifting, golf, triathlon)

### Data Structure
- **Type:** Python dictionary (dict)
- **Keys:** Paris 2024 event name format (str)
- **Values:** Historical Olympic event name format (str)
- **Size:** 330 entries
- **Memory:** ~30 KB

### Performance
- **Lookup:** O(1) - dictionary hash lookup
- **Space:** O(1) - constant size
- **Usage:** Called for each Paris event result during `add_paris_objects()`

### Naming Convention Differences

**Paris 2024 Format:**

"{Gender}'s {Distance/Type} {Sport}"
Example: "Men's 100m Athletics"


**Historical Olympic Format:**

"{Distance/Type}, {Gender}"
Example: "100 metres, Men"
Examples
python# Athletics
EVENT_MAP["Men's 100m Athletics"] = "100 metres, Men"
EVENT_MAP["Women's Marathon Athletics"] = "Marathon, Women"

# Swimming
EVENT_MAP["Men's 100m Freestyle Swimming"] = "100 metres Freestyle, Men"

# New sports
EVENT_MAP["B-Boys Breaking"] = "Breakdance, Men"
EVENT_MAP["Women's Street Skateboarding"] = "Street, Women"

# Team events
EVENT_MAP["Mixed 4 x 100m Medley Relay Swimming"] = "4 × 100 metres Medley Relay, Mixed"
Special Cases Handled
Sport name variations:
python# Code in add_paris_objects() handles:
"Trampoline Gymnastics" → "Trampolining"
"Equestrian" → "Equestrian Eventing"
Mixed/Open events:
pythonEVENT_MAP["Mixed Team Archery"] = "Team, Mixed"
EVENT_MAP["Marathon Race Walk Relay Mixed Athletics"] = "Marathon, Open"
Impact on System
Without EVENT_MAP:

Event names wouldn't match between datasets
Results would appear as separate events
Medal counts would be incorrect
Data aggregation would fail

With EVENT_MAP:

Seamless integration of Paris 2024 events
Consistent event naming across 130 years
Proper historical comparison possible
Accurate medal tallies

Usage in Code
Found in add_paris_objects():
pythonEVENT_MAP[full_event] if full_event in EVENT_MAP else full_event


**Behavior:**
- If event exists in map → Use standardized name
- If not in map → Use Paris name as-is (indicates new event or mapping gap)

### Data Quality

**Completeness:**
- Covers all Paris 2024 medal events
- Handles new sports (breaking, skateboarding, sport climbing, surfing)
- Includes mixed team events

**Accuracy:**
- Generated by AI but validated against Olympic data
- Critical for correct event matching
- Any missing mapping would create orphaned event results



## Integration with Main System

### How These Files Work Together

Paris Athlete Name: "José Martínez"
    ↓
normalize_name() uses CHARACTER_MAP
    ↓
Normalized: "Jose Martinez"
    ↓
create_unique_id(): "jose martinez,esp"
    ↓
Check Olympic database for duplicate


Paris Event: "Men's 100m Athletics"
    ↓
add_paris_objects() uses EVENT_MAP
    ↓
Standardized: "100 metres, Men"
    ↓
Matches historical Olympic format
    ↓
Enables cross-year medal tallies
Performance Impact
Both files add negligible overhead:

Memory: ~40 KB total (constant)
Lookup time: O(1) dictionary access
Load time: Imported once at startup

Maintenance Considerations
special_character_map.py:

Stable - character sets don't change
May need updates for new Unicode characters
Currently comprehensive for Olympic nations

event_map.py:

Needs updates for each new Olympics
New sports require new mappings
Rule changes may alter event names


## Summary ##
Both files serve as lookup tables that enable:

Name normalization - Consistent athlete matching across character encodings
Event standardization - Uniform event naming across Olympic editions
Data quality - Prevents duplicates and mismatches
Historical continuity - Links modern data to 130-year Olympic history

Data Structure Choice: Dictionary is perfect for both use cases

Fast O(1) lookups
Simple key-value mapping
Minimal memory footprint
Easy to maintain and extend


Saved significant manual mapping effort
High accuracy for comprehensive coverage
Properly disclosed in file headers
